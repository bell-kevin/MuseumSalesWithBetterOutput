# MuseumSalesWithBetterOutput
Museum Sales With Better Output. Make a COPY of the Museum Sales project from Ch 3, the second one where the user enters the number of students. Change the first output line so it says this is Part 3, as shown in the sample session below. Format the output of the total cost so that it uses comma separators and shows 2 decimal places.
